The study of global politics used to be the study of independence states, arguing that states are like billiard balls- impermeable and self-contained, and influence each other through external pressures, colliding with each other as many billiard balls on a table. Most 'collisions' are linked to military and security matters; thus reflecting that power and survival are paramount in states, as are they important on a more global level. The model has two key implications: a clear distinction of domestic politics and international politics (boarders matter in the distinction).
