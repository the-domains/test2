The study of global politics used to be the study of independence states, arguing that states are like billiard balls- impermeable and self-contained, and influence each other through external pressures, colliding with each other as many billiard balls on a table. Most 'collisions' are linked to military and security matters; thus reflecting that power and survival are paramount in states, as are they important on a more global level. The model has two key implications: a clear distinction of domestic politics and international politics (borders matter in the distinction).

China's actions in pursuit of the national interest territorial integrity, often is detriment to the success of peaceful rise. First, in China's efforts to ensure territorial integrity, China has used a combination of hard and soft power. For example, the anti-secession laws of 2005 dictate a military response to secessionist provinces. This clear act of aggression can be seen as detrimental to peaceful rise as use of military can be seen as threatening to external global actors. Secondly, in 2014 China constructed artificial islands in the South China Sea to act as military bases. This was done to ensure territorial integrity, however China's use of muscle has not been well perceived by the international community. As well as military power, China has used political power to ensure the protection of the South China Sea. This is evident in China's request of Cambodia to exclude any talks about the South China Sea out of ASEAN meetings, Heng describes Cambodia as part of China's 'string of pearls' acting as a political partner. Achieving a peaceful rise is imperative for China, success of this relies on China's other use of powers and if they are perceived as threatening.
