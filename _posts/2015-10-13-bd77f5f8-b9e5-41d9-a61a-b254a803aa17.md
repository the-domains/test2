The study of global politics used to be the study of independence states, arguing that states are like billiard balls- impermeable and self-contained, and influence each other through external pressures, colliding with each other as many billiard balls on a table. Most 'collisions' are linked to military and security matters; thus reflecting that power and survival are paramount in states, as are they important on a more global level. The model has two key implications: a clear distinction of domestic politics and international politics (boarders matter in the distinction).

Non-Governmental Organisations: a private, non-commercial group/ body that seeks to achieve its goal through non-violence. They often take on globally beneficial activities. Very early examples were the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade (1787), and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The first official recognition was by the UN in 1948, where many were given consultative status. Some believe that only groups acknowledged by the UN should be regarded as 'true' NGOs. There is a common distinction between operational (primary purpose is design and implantation of development related projects) and advocacy (promote or defend causes). During the 1990s, the growth of NGOs exploded- by 2000, over one thousand groups had consultive status by the UN, with estimates of the total number of NGOs over 30,000\. National NGOs in the US are estimated to be around 2 million.
